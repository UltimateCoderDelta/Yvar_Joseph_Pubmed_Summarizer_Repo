given her non - responsiveness to the treatment , she was readmitted to the hospital .\\nthe patient was previously healthy and newly married , with no prior history of diseases or drug consumption .\\nshe was lethargic , though hemodynamically stable according to physical examinations , and her body mass index ( bmi ) was 17 kg / m at the admission time .\\nthe significant observation was a mobile mass ( 2  1 cm ) with soft consistency behind the left sternocleidomastoid in left cervical , axillary and inguinal lymph nodes ; no redness or warmth was reported in the mass .\\near , nose , and throat checkups showed normal results and the patient had no complaints of abdominal pain , lower limb pain , or diarrhea .\\nin addition , no facial or body skin rash was reported and other findings were normal . in para - clinical evaluations , the results of chest radiograph , chest ct scan , electrocardiogram and echocardiography were normal . moreover , in pelvic and abdominal ultrasounds , no abnormalities were observed except for the enlargement of the spleen . in the patient s initial blood test , white blood cell ( wbc ) count of 2000  \\ncells / mm and the presence of 1% atypical lymphocytes with an increase in immature neutrophils ( bands ) , hemoglobin of 11.3   g / dl and a mild thrombocytopenia , as well as high alkaline phosphatase , high c - reactive protein , and an erythrocyte sedimentation rate ( esr ) of 48 were reported .\\nblood tests and examinations of urine and stool samples were all negative . the results of sputum acid - fast bacilli culture and antinuclear antibody test were negative , as well .\\nsimilarly , the results of autoimmune screening , as well as toxoplasma and cytomegalovirus tests were negative .\\nmacroscopic examination of the lymph node capsule showed a creamy grey - colored mass with soft consistency , homogeneity , and a dimension of 0.5  1  2 cm . in the microscopic study ( at low magnification ) , partial effacement of the lymph node structure and pale patchy infiltrates were reported .\\nat the center of the lesion , an extensive coagulative necrosis composed of cellular debris and free of neutrophilic or eosinophilic infiltrates was observed ( figures 1 and 2 ) . finally , the kikuchi s disease was diagnosed based on the findings . considering the improved symptoms of the patient after two weeks of hospitalization , she was discharged from the hospital in good general health and received anti - inflammatory medications .\\ngiven the improvements in her symptoms , the medications were gradually discontinued and she started to be followed up on a monthly basis . during the 8-year follow - up of the patient , except for the mean sublingual temperature of 37.8c which was reported once or twice a year ( continuing for a couple of days ) , no other significant findings were reported .\\nthe patient was in good general health during the follow - up and her examination results were normal .\\nthe patient had two healthy pregnancies in 2010 and 2012 and was in a good general condition during her pregnancies and lactation . in august 2014 ,\\nthe patient was referred to the hospital with high fever , night sweats , weight loss and anorexia ( bmi = 16\\nafter a one - month delay , painful generalized lymphadenopathy in left cervical , axillary and inguinal lymph nodes with soft consistency and mobility was reported ; however , no redness or warmth was reported in the mass . in the second blood test , neither leukopenia nor high esr was observed . the results of chest radiography as well as those of abdominal and pelvic ultrasounds were normal .\\nconsidering the patient s unwillingness to undergo repeated biopsy , she underwent a corticosteroid regimen .\\nafter three months of using prednisone , the patient s fever subsided and her lymphadenopathy was impalpable .\\nkfd , also known as hnl , is a self - limiting condition , causing lymphadenopathy .\\nthis disease is most commonly observed in adults younger than 40 years of age , with a female predominance in previous studies ( 3 ) .\\nother less commonly reported presentations include leukopenia , atypical lymphocytes on peripheral smear , liver dysfunction , bone marrow involvement , fatigue , hepatosplenomegaly , and skin rash ( 2 ) .\\nalthough the disease is characterized by regional lymphadenopathy , few patients show generalized lymphadenopathy . in the present case\\n, there was simultaneous involvement of cervical lymph nodes with axillary and inguinal lymph nodes together with uncommon symptoms including leukopenia , severe weight loss and splenomegaly , indicating a generalized lymphoma which often leads to a misdiagnosis .\\na definite diagnosis of kfd may be made only via histopathological analysis by open lymph node biopsy ( 1 ) .\\nthere is no specific treatment for kfd , although in severe cases , the use of corticosteroids has been recommended for the prevention of fatal complications ( 1 ) .\\nthe signs and symptoms of kfd usually resolve after several months ( 1 , 2 ) . in a review of cases with kfd by kucukardali et al .\\nin addition , a low recurrence rate ( 3 - 4% ) has been reported in previous studies ( 1 , 2 ) .\\npatients with recurrent episodes are more likely to present fever , cough , and fatigue , along with frequent extranodal involvement in the initial presentation ( 7 ) . in comparison with previous studies ,\\nher disease was complicated by the return of symptoms eight years after the initial diagnosis , with symptoms such as fever , fatigue , severe weight loss and generalized lymphadenopathy . in the present case ,\\na definite diagnosis of kfd is made by tissue biopsy , particularly whole lymph node biopsy ( 4 , 5 ) . in the present case ,\\nthe diagnosis of hnl was confirmed according to the results from the pathological slices ; also , there is a chance that more severe cases get included with pathological confirmation , while mild cases get excluded due to follow - up loss .\\nalthough the etiology of kfd recurrence is unknown , certain viral infections including epstein - barr ( eb ) virus , parvovirus b19 and human herpesvirus-8 have been hypothesized to be among the triggers for kfd relapse ( 8) . as stephan et al\\n. indicated , the recurrence of hnl is associated with the persistence of eb virus infections ( 9 ) . in addition , atarashi et al . , reported a case of recurrent hnl in a human t - lymphotropic virus type i carrier . in the present case , infectious etiologies including eb virus , cytomegalovirus and hiv were all negative ( 10 ) .\\nit is unknown whether other viral infections were associated with hnl in the present case .\\nas evidence suggests , kfd may be a precursor for systemic lupus erythematosus ( sle ) , as both conditions have concurrent , coexisting patterns in patients ( 11 ) .\\ncheng et al . , described the clinical manifestations and outcomes of 195 patients diagnosed with hnl . in the mentioned study ,\\na total of 14 out of 96 patients ( 14.6% ) had recurrent hnl and five of them developed autoimmune diseases such as sle ( 12 ) .\\nit seems that individuals with hnl are more susceptible to sle ; thus , they should be routinely screened for this disorder ( 2 ) . with the results of the present study ,\\nit is important to differentiate kfd from other conditions ; in this case , it can inhibit adverse drug reactions in patients and prevent empirical treatments , especially with antibiotics that impose financial burdens on families . in conclusion , although kfd is an uncommon condition , it should be featured in the list of differential diagnoses of tender lymphadenopathy , especially lymphadenopathy localized to the cervical region .\\nhowever , although the disease takes a self - limiting clinical course in most cases , we reported a case of kfd with a prolonged relapse of eight years . full recovery with a good response to corticosteroid regimen was achieved after the recurrence ; therefore , considering the recurrence of kfd , long - term follow - up of patients with kfd is necessary .\",\n          \"muscle contraction produces force and change in the muscle s length , i.e. , velocity .\\nskeletal muscles are primarily classified into parallel muscles and \\n pennate muscles , based on the muscle s form and structure . in parallel muscles , the \\n shortening velocity is faster and the range of motion is larger because the muscle fibers \\n are arranged longitudinally and directly reflect mechanical shortening .\\nin contrast , in \\n pennate muscles , the shortening velocity is slower and the range of motion is shorter \\n because muscle fibers are arranged diagonally with a certain pennate angle .\\npennate muscles \\n exert stronger force because they comprise a greater number of muscle fibers , with a larger \\n cross - sectional area .\\ngenerally , parallel muscles are located at joints , such as the elbow \\n joint , and require exercise to change the joint angle significantly .\\nconversely , many \\n pennate muscles are located in the lower extremities and counteract the effects of \\n gravity2 , 3 .\\nthe semitendinosus muscle ( st ) composes a part of the hamstrings and has a characteristic \\n form ( fig .\\n1.structure of the semitendinosus musclethe line of tendinous inscription ( arrow 1 ) lies at the center of the muscle belly . \\n\\nthe proximal compartment has the \\n structure of a parallel muscle , whereas the distal compartment is considered a pennate \\n muscle because it has a pennate angle ( arrow 2 ; recorded at 65% from the proximal \\n tendon ) . ) .\\nthe st has a tendinous inscription ( ti ) in the center of the muscle belly , and its \\n muscle fibers are divided into a proximal compartment ( pc ) and a distal compartment ( dc ) . \\n\\nthe pc of the st is a parallel muscle , but the dc has a pennate structure with an average \\n 12.9 pennate angle4 . in other words ,\\nthe \\n st comprises both parallel and pennate muscles dependent on the existence of the ti . \\n\\nfunctional differences can therefore be assumed between the two compartments , because each \\n has a unique innervation5 , 6 .\\nstructure of the semitendinosus muscle the line of tendinous inscription ( arrow 1 ) lies at the center of the muscle belly . \\n\\nthe proximal compartment has the \\n structure of a parallel muscle , whereas the distal compartment is considered a pennate \\n muscle because it has a pennate angle ( arrow 2 ; recorded at 65% from the proximal \\n tendon ) .\\nreportedly , the st is susceptible to injury in the dc on the sports field7 .\\nit is believed that the muscle fibers are \\n particularly easily injured during eccentric contraction because they can not withstand \\n elongation due to the load3 , 8 .\\nfor example , the dc is often damaged during the swing phase \\n of running .\\nweakness of the hamstring muscles was predicted to underlie this damage9,10,11 , and hamstring strengthening exercises \\n have been proposed as a precaution12 , 13 .\\nalso , the increase in stiffness of the \\n hamstrings may serve as a cause of shoulder and elbow pain14 and decrease of dynamic postural control15 .\\nalthough there are many reports on the injury of the dc \\n and on the treatment of stiffness of the hamstrings16 , 17 , few studies have \\n considered the difference between the pc and dc . in the context of our clinical rehabilitation for patients who have undergone total knee \\n arthroplasty , it was observed that flexibility of the dc of the st is lost , but not that of \\n the pc .\\nit was also observed that muscle force or \\n range of motion in the knee joint increases with improved flexibility of the dc .\\nhowever , \\n this is difficult to prove clinically because the st has a complex form .\\ntherefore , it is important to determine the functional differences between the pc and dc of \\n the st . in this study , using an ultrasound device , muscle fiber lengths in each compartment \\n of the st were measured during knee flexion and hip extension to determine the functional \\n differences between the dc and pc as well as changes in joint angle .\\nthe left legs of seven men aged 2138 years , without orthopedic or neurological system \\n disorders were examined . after the purpose of this study was explained to them , all of them \\n provided written informed consent in order to participate .\\nall procedures in this study were \\n approved by our institutional ethics committee ( no . 39 - 2 ) .\\nthe participants performed knee flexion ( kf ) and hip extension ( he ) movements in the prone \\n position , with 0 extension of the knee joint and 25 flexion of the hip joint .\\nkf was defined as a flexion movement \\n from about 0 to 80 knee flexion at 25 hip flexion .\\nhe was defined as an extension \\n movement from about 25 to 0 hip flexion at 0 knee flexion .\\nthese movement angles were \\n selected with reference to those that occur during normal walking and because of the ease of \\n the movements .\\nparticipants performed one movement every 4 seconds with the aid of an \\n electric metronome .\\nthe ti of the st was recorded at least twice , and the pennate part was \\n recorded at least three times ( fig .\\nthere were two movements and two recorded parts . in each movement \\n ( knee flexion and hip extension ) , the tendinous inscription and pennate parts were \\n recorded at different times.b .\\nultrasound images were recorded at the tendinous inscription part and \\n distal pennate part , during two movements , for each subject ( a ) .\\nthe knee and hip joints \\n angles were recorded using a video camera , in synchrony with the ultrasound images \\n ( c ) .\\nthe ultrasound ( a ) and joint angle ( b ) images were analyzed using dartfish \\n animation software ( c ) . ;

study aimed to identify the functional differences between the pc and dc of the st \\n during kf or he .\\ndecreases in muscle fiber length in the pc and dc were measured using \\n ultrasound exam , and the correlation between decreases in muscle fiber length and joint \\n angle were calculated .\\nprevious studies have reported differences in the examined muscles . \\n these studies compared muscle activity in the medial and lateral sites in the biceps brachii \\n longus muscle using wire electrodes and reported a difference in the activities of these \\n muscles during elbow flexion , forearm supination , or shoulder exorotation19 , 20 .\\nadditionally , some studies compared muscle fiber and tendon length \\n during walking using an ultrasound device and reported differences in the length of these \\n fibers during each walking phase21 , 22 .\\nhowever , the aforementioned studies did \\n not examine in - series muscle fibers as well as the pc and dc of st .\\nthe present study \\n hypothesized that the proximal muscle fiber and distal muscle fiber might have functional \\n differences .\\nit was found that decreases in muscle fiber length in the pc and dc correlated with the \\n joint angle during kf .\\nin addition , the longitudinal length of the whole st was correlated \\n with the joint angle during kf .\\nthe difference in correlation was too small to determine the \\n exact functional difference between the pc and dc , and it is possible that there are not \\n functional differences between the pc and dc during kf . during he , there were no significant correlations between decreases in muscle fiber length \\n in the pc and dc and joint angles .\\nhowever , there were differences in the shortening or \\n elongation of muscle fibers ; i.e. , these displayed different fascicle behavior .\\nthese \\n results differed from other results in that the muscle fiber of the pc shortened during he . \\n\\nthe pennate muscle can control the change of muscle tendon complex length by changing the \\n pennate angle23 .\\nthis difference during \\n he could be meaningful and was one of the functional differences .\\nit is important to note that the measurement methods used for each compartment were \\n different .\\nmeasurement of decreases in muscle fiber length in the pc used the shift of the \\n ti , recording all muscle fibers of the pc .\\nconversely , measurement of the dc did not cover \\n all muscle fibers of the dc , but only those in the pennate part .\\nalso , it is necessary to \\n obtain three - dimensional measurements because the st is staggered5 , and it is possible that this staggering differs between the \\n pc and dc .\\nnext , it is necessary to consider that each compartment affects the tension of \\n the other .\\nwhen one compartment is undergoing contraction , afferent information from muscle \\n spindles and golgi tendon organs in the other compartment changes . the response from \\n afferent information was different even in the same muscle at every site , e.g. medial and \\n lateral head of the gastrocnemius24 . in \\n st muscle ,\\nthe afferent information of pc and dc may produce different responses . during kf , \\n the correlation between the pc and dc did not determine those differences , which suggested \\n that the pc and dc produced similar level of tension . during he , the muscle fiber of the dc \\n might be eccentrically contracted , although it might be passively stretched by muscle \\n activity of the pc .\\nthe muscle activity of the dc might be weaker than that \\n of the pc , but would not be inactive .\\nin addition , the longitudinal length of the whole st was correlated with joint angle during \\n he .\\nthe fascicle behavior during he differed between the pc and dc , but both compartments \\n shortened as a whole because the muscle activity was coordinated .\\nit was unclear why the pc , \\n parallel muscle , contracted stronger than did the dc during he .\\nin parallel muscles , the \\n shortening velocity is faster and the range of motion is larger than those in pennate \\n muscles . during he ,\\nthe change of muscle tendon complex length should be smaller , because \\n few joint ranges were measured . during he , it was predicted that the pc played fewer roles \\n and contracted weakly , but our results did not support this prediction .\\ntherefore , the dc that exerted stronger force might contract more weakly than \\n does the pc .\\nour results can be applied in clinical contexts . in the context of sports , it is thought \\n that the st is prone to injury7 , \\n particularly during eccentric contraction3 , 8 .\\nour results suggest that muscle fibers tend \\n to elongate in the dc , which may be the cause of many injuries to the dc of the st . in \\n addition\\n, rapid hip extension may cause injury to the dc of the st , because hip extension \\n caused elongation of the muscle fibers of the dc .\\nfirst , the muscle fiber length of the pc \\n was measured movement for the skin , but movement of the skin for the bone was not measured . \\n the skin around the joint moved to a greater extent for the bone during joint movement25 , which may have caused a skin effect . \\n\\nthe proportion of muscle activity that each \\n compartment contributed to a movement could not be determined and the muscle activity was \\n not measured with , for example , electromyograms .\\nin addition to the gluteus maximus , the \\n gluteus medius , gluteus minimus , hamstrings , and adductors muscles act as hip extensors . \\n\\nadditionally , the hamstrings and gracilis , sartorius , popliteus , and gastrocnemius muscles \\n act as knee flexors .\\nregarding the hip joint in particular , the contribution of the st may \\n be minimal , because the correlation of the change in joint angle and decreases in muscle \\n fiber length was not significant .\\nfinally , a single joint movement was examined by one method of force production and \\n contraction velocity through a partial range of its motion .\\nthese components of movement \\n were important with respect to the differences between parallel and pennate muscles . in \\n addition , during walking and other activities ,\\nthere are other effects , such as ground force \\n reaction , and the activity of other muscles .\\nthe clinical implications of our findings may \\n be limited , and it is necessary to perform additional investigation and to consider various \\n other factors .\",\n          \"anyone who has ever suffered jet lag knows firsthand that our bodies are persistent in how they keep track of time .\\nthis timekeeping system structures the different physiological processes to work together over the course of the day in synchrony with the physical world .\\nthe master network coordinating this timing system is based in the suprachiasmatic nucleus ( scn ) of the hypothalamus , where neurons exhibit circadian ( lit .  about a day  ) rhythms in their electrical activity and are driven by cell - autonomous molecular feedback loops.1 these neural activity rhythms are critical for circadian output and are reciprocally required for the sustained generation of their own internal molecular oscillations .\\noutput from this scn clock regulates oscillatory sleep and arousal control centers , leading downstream to the organization of our daily sleep \\nwake behavior ( figure 1 ) . during jet lag , a rapid shift in the sleep \\nwake cycle transiently disrupts this coordinated regulation , and ( 1 ) the clock network loses synchrony with the external environment and ( 2 ) the many oscillators within our bodies become desynchronized with each other .\\ntemporary circadian desynchronization has many effects , but the most obvious are impaired sleep at night and excessive daytime sleepiness during the day , which bring patients to the attention of the sleep clinician .\\nthis article provides a framework for understanding the biological basis of jet lag and for recommending management strategies .\\nunderstanding jet lag can help us address the broader problem of circadian misalignment , which has increasingly been associated with increased risk for cancer , metabolic disease , cardiovascular dysfunction , mood disorders , and cognitive decline.24\\nalthough there have been a number of attempts to model the processes that regulate the sleep \\nwake cycle , the two - process model of sleep regulation has had the most widespread acceptance across the chronobiological community ( figure 2 ) . in the simplest terms\\n, this model proposes that sleep propensity is governed by two predominant , sometimes competing processes : one being a homeostatic load accumulated of sleep need based on time since last sleep episode , termed \\nprocess s  , and another being a circadian - controlled rhythm in wakefulness or sleep , termed  process c.57 the two major processes governing basal sleep organization keep track of time but can be thought of very differently : the circadian component , process c , is an oscillator that runs indefinitely and consistently to dictate the time at which events occur , whereas the process regulating homeostatic sleep ( process s ) operates like an hourglass which tells intervals of time .\\nsleep and wake behaviors are the sum result of several oscillatory and hourglass processes acting together in concert with external signals that regulate their precise initiation , termination , and duration , but for the sake of modeling , their regulatory components have been simplified and reduced to process s and process c.8,9\\nalthough sleep itself is a behavior , in humans and some animal models , we can quantify different properties of sleep by measuring cortical activity with the electroencephalogram ( eeg ) .\\neeg recordings have been useful in parsing levels of arousal and sleep , such as rapid eye movement ( rem ) and nonrapid eye movement ( nrem ) , and also in relating certain electrophysiological correlates with other parameters related to sleep and wake states .\\nevidence suggests that delta power or slow - wave activity ( swa ) during nrem sleep can be used to estimate process s , as delta power increases logarithmically as waking is prolonged.5,6 conversely , core body temperature is often used as a measure of process c , as it is relatively free from masking by movement artifacts and itself is a robust rhythm .\\nsleep propensity is greatest during the falling limb of the circadian body temperature rhythm and decreases on the rising limb.10 there have been different hypotheses presented as to how specifically the circadian pacemaker dictates sleep  wake behavior at a physiological level.1113 although there is no definitive consensus , data support a model by which process c actively promotes different aspects of each behavioral state rather than passively gating state transitions.14 at an additional level of temporal regulation , kleitman15 proposed that humans followed a basic rest activity cycle ( brac ) that exhibits an ultradian rhythm .\\nrem sleep cycles through the course of the night , and ultradian rhythms in alertness during the course of the day with a similar period\\nwake rhythm could be a series of thresholds set by ultradian variations coupled to circadian variations .\\nthus during certain times of the day , the circadian system promotes cycling levels of arousal , whereas during other times , it promotes cycling through different stages of sleep .\\ninterestingly , there are certain aspects of sleep that appear to be strongly regulated by the circadian system that incorporate this organization .\\nboth human and animal studies have shown that there are circadian rhythms regulating arousal and rem sleep , but nrem sleep appears to be more strongly under the control of a sleep homeostatic drive.9,14 in understanding how the circadian system influences sleep and wake , it is important to remember that process c is one of many oscillatory processes , distinguishable from other oscillatory processes in the circadian system , but sharing a common point of origin .\\njet lag and other disruptions in process c may be the result of perturbations in the circadian input pathway , the master oscillatory network in the scn of the hypothalamus that organizes the body s clocks , or in the specific outputs along the sleep \\nin mammals , the part of the nervous system responsible for the organization of circadian behavior lies in a paired structure in the hypothalamus known as the scn .\\nalthough other cells in the body show oscillatory properties , the clock within the scn is considered the master oscillator that coordinates daily rhythms.1 the scn is a bilaterally paired nucleus made up of tightly compacted , small - diameter neurons just lateral to the third ventricle atop the optic chiasm .\\nsubcortical light information is transmitted directly to the scn via the retinohypothalamic tract ( figure 1 ) , whereas thalamic and midbrain inputs modulate light information and transmit nonphotic signals.16 the scn integrates this environmental information and modifies the oscillatory activity of its neurons to create coherent , robust , neural , and humoral signals to the rest of the brain and periphery.17 the neural outputs of the scn largely travel to other hypothalamic regions including the subparaventricular zone and the dorsomedial nucleus.1820 these hypothalamic relay nuclei send projections throughout the central nervous system and endocrine system , providing multiple pathways by which the scn can convey temporal information to a diffuse network of sleep and arousal - promoting centers.21,22 interestingly , this communication appears to be bidirectional , as sleep state information is communicated back to the scn as well.23 the expression of behavioral rhythms involves a far more complex route than a linear pathway from a single scn neuron to sleep  wake activity .\\nanimal studies have indicated that part of the scn is primarily involved in spontaneous rhythm generation , whereas the other part is primarily involved in conveying environmental resetting signals back to the rhythm generating neurons.24 downstream of the scn , structures receiving temporal cues from the scn have to incorporate this temporal information among a vast network of other inputs . to make matters more complex , other neurons and cells throughout the body show endogenous oscillations themselves in transcriptional activity of clock genes.4 thus , the scn exerts its actions on other clock - like systems throughout the body rather than just by amplifying its own timekeeping signal as the body s only rhythm . in sleep ,\\nthe scn signal is integrated across sleep and wake - control centers , and activity specific to this pathway generates the rhythms observed in process c. under certain experimental conditions , process c can be uncoupled from other oscillations that utilize separate neural pathways.18,25 scn lesion studies in animals have primarily been used to model sleep  wake regulation in the absence of process c. in addition to exhibiting arrhythmicity in the timing of the sleep \\nwake cycle , some studies show that scn - lesioned animals will sleep the same amount over a 24-hour period , but this will be expressed in a fragmented ultradian rhythm over the course of the day.26,27 there are studies to suggest that total sleep time also increases after lesioning , but this might be a species - specific phenomenon.12,13 although rebound in response to sleep deprivation is relatively similar in the absence of the scn,26 the appropriate timing of this rebound is disrupted .\\nanimal studies have also shown that rem sleep appears to be highly regulated by the circadian system.25 studies of lesioned rats showed that transitions into rem sleep are facilitated by the scn during the rest phase , but the amount of rem sleep , once initiated , is determined primarily by homeostatic mechanisms.28 there are distinctly robust contributions of process c to arousal , rem sleep , and sleep consolidation.14 the role of process c in both arousal and rem sleep may be explained by the previously described brac model in which there is a strong circadian regulation of the similar cortical activity accompanying wakefulness and rem sleep .\\nthere is a very short and specific window , related in phase to the endogenous body temperature rhythm ( as it approaches its daily minimum ) , in which one may fall asleep and maintain this state throughout the night.14 one explanation for this is that the circadian sleep  wake signal might be suppressing a drive toward arousal during the second half of a sleep period.10,14 in insomnia , this drive might be insufficient , ultimately leading to inappropriately timed wakefulness.29 the misalignment of the core body temperature minimum with the light - dark cycle is a major target for the treatment of jet lag - like desynchrony .\\ncircadian rhythms of both nocturnal and diurnal mammals are most sensitive to light resetting during the night .\\nalthough there are other , nonphotic means to resetting the clock , light has been shown to be the most robust.30 a low intensity pulse of 180 lux light ( typical office lighting ) that is appropriately timed is sufficient to significantly reset circadian rhythms in humans.31 the direction and magnitude of light resetting depend on the endogenous phase of the clock , and this relationship is summarized in the form of a phase response curve ( prc ) . although light - based prcs have been extensively researched and documented,32,33 they all suggest the same basic pattern : in the first part of the night , light delays circadian rhythms .\\nin contrast , light exposure during the later part of the night or early morning advances rhythms to an earlier phase , resulting in earlier bedtime and waking up earlier in the morning .\\nthe point at which a light cue switches its effects on the clock from delaying to advancing is around the core body temperature minimum , a time during which feelings of subjective sleepiness are strongest.32 in the middle of the subjective day , when one is normally exposed to high levels of ambient light , there is little to no shifting effect of light on circadian rhythms .\\nit is difficult to examine light effects on sleep independently of circadian rhythms as light has arousing effects that can  mask  rhythms in activity without resetting the circadian clock.34 light affects sleep both through process c and concurrently through other mechanisms , namely midbrain arousal circuits and hormonal signaling , which , like circadian rhythms , are directly connected to the non - image - forming visual system.35,36 light reaches the scn directly via a projection of intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cell axons that contain the recently discovered photopigment melanopsin ( figure 1).36,37 this pigment is most sensitive to light in the blue wavelength range38 and is necessary for normal resetting of behavioral rhythms in animals following alterations in their light - dark cycle.3941 human circadian rhythms are most sensitive to resetting at light wavelengths around 460 nm , which coincides with the photoresponsive range of melanopsin.42 interestingly , melanopsin - containing neurons not only project to the scn , but also to the pretectum,36 where light acts independently of the circadian system to acutely induce sleep in nocturnal mammals during their active phase.43 melanopsin knockout mice fail to sleep during a nighttime light pulse and show less total sleep time and swa following sleep deprivation.44 thus this photoreceptive pathway affects sleep both dependent and independent of process c through multiple targets .\\nmany scn efferents are routed through the paraventricular hypothalamus , which signals to the autonomic intermediolateral cell column of the spinal cord , and eventually to the pineal gland to produce the nocturnal hormone melatonin.45 melatonin is carried throughout the body with targets in both the brain and periphery , it exhibits a robust circadian rhythm , and it is synthesized in the pineal gland in the absence of light.46 melatonin receptors are strongly expressed in the scn , and melatonin is thought to feedback to the scn to modulate its rhythmic profile.46 interestingly , the scn has been shown to be important for both the circadian rhythm in melatonin synthesis as well as the light - induced suppression of melatonin.47 although the scn is implicated in both pathways , different subregions have been mapped out for each effect on melatonin ( circadian vs acute).48 this would suggest that at least some environmental information that resets the clock does so downstream of the master oscillator in the scn .\\nalthough in mammals melatonin is not necessary for the expression of behavioral rhythmicity , it is necessary in birds and reptiles.49 in humans , increases in melatonin at the appropriate circadian phase are associated with inducing sleepiness.50 exogenous melatonin at higher doses also has this hypnotic effect , and the mechanism by which melatonin induces sleepiness may be explained by vasodilatory effects . in warm - blooded animals , melatonin is thought to adjust the setpoint at which core body temperature is regulated , thereby allowing higher blood flow to distal areas of the body and heat loss from the body s core.51 thermosensitive neurons in the distal body communicate temperature information back to the preoptic anterior hypothalamus , which contains sleep - active neurons that send inhibitory projections to arousal - promoting circuits in the brain.52 although this pathway does not by itself account for all sleep  wake regulation , it does offer one viable explanation as to the association between sleepiness and the daily core body temperature minimum .\\nwhen circadian rhythm disruptions occur , desynchrony between clock systems within an individual as well as desynchrony with the environment follows . even at the level of the scn , different subregions shift at different rates.53 in general ,\\na phase shift within the scn is relatively rapid , but in other parts of the brain and also in the periphery , it can take many days to reset rhythms .\\noutputs from the circadian clock regulate key components in physiological pathways to drive rhythms in these systems , but the molecular components of the clock in each cell can also comprise cellular pathways with additional functions , including regulating metabolism and the cycle of cell division.4 it is , therefore , important to understand the mechanisms behind desynchrony , as these disruptions not only affect temporal organization of networks , but also of the basic functions for cell survival . although symptoms of jet lag are generally temporary , they can be disruptive and include difficulty sleeping , excessive daytime sleepiness , general malaise , impaired performance , and gastrointestinal ( gi ) upset.54 the severity of jet lag symptoms and the ability to adapt to the new time zone are typically influenced by the direction of travel ( slower adaptation when traveling east ) and the number of time zones crossed.32,33 not all travelers crossing time zones suffer from jet lag to the same degree , and these differences probably result from individual variation , similar to those reported for adaptation to shift work.32 although experimentally it has been shown that circadian rhythms can be shifted by light independent of shifts in the sleep \\nit has been demonstrated , for instance , that sleep deprivation can damp the effects of a light - based phase shift,56 and that bright light , conversely , can counteract some of the eeg changes that normally accompany sleep deprivation.57 studies following transatlantic airline passengers show that there are specific , sleep quality changes altered as a result of jet lag . after an eastward journey , when the sleep  wake cycle is shifted ahead , travelers show increased difficulty in initiating sleep by the second night that continues for the next few days in the new time zone.58 this difference is not observed on the first night , suggesting that immediately following eastward travel , process s can induce sleep despite a misaligned process c , possibly due to sleep deprivation or fatigue associated with travel .\\nwhen simulating eastbound travel in the lab through advancing the time of sleep onset , there is an increase in time spent awake in the earlier part of the evening during the night of the shift.59 the results from these 2 paradigms suggest that the act of traveling itself helps promote sleep on the first night in the new environment .\\nthis travel - induced increase in sleep pressure independent of process c is supported by marked increases in stage 2 sleep on only the first night in the new time zone.58 there is interestingly a compensatory increase in rem sleep several nights later.58 changes in sleep quality after a phase delaying westward fight , in contrast , last fewer days when crossing the same number of time zones.32,58 westward bound travelers show increased swa on the first night in the new time zone , suggesting an increase in sleep pressure following travel ( much like in eastward travelers ) . simulating westbound fight in the lab , modeled by delayed sleep onset , results in an increased ( albeit nonsignificant ) trend in transitions to terminal wakefulness during the first night of the new sleep schedule as well . in both experimental paradigms\\nhowever , there is also an increase in sleep pressure that is due to an extended time since last sleep episode ( ie , an increase in process s ) . in this way\\n, westward travel is going to consistently involve an additional factor that increases sleep pressure for at least the first night following travel , as compared with eastbound travel.59 in summary , there are patterns in the changes of sleep quality following transmeridian travel that may present in the clinic . for the first day following travel , travelers are likely to fall asleep with less difficulty due to an increased sleep pressure that arises because of sleep deprivation and fatigue from traveling . if eastbound , after the first night , individuals will likely have more difficulty in initiating sleep from a few days to around a week following travel . in westward travel , there may be more difficulty in maintaining sleep later into the night , but this ( mis)alignment is often restored and sleep symptoms are greatly reduced within only a few days post travel.58 in the laboratory , timed bright light exposure in the early evening , which mimics the light resetting effects on the clock of traveling westward , results in increased time to fall asleep for 2 nights following light exposure when the timing of the sleep  wake cycle is kept constant.60 the above experimental paradigm models what might occur upon returning home after traveling westward for a short - term trip .\\nthe changes in sleep could be explained by the evening light delaying the rhythm in core body temperature , wherein the descent toward the temperature minimum is delayed and the associated sleep - related effects of this fall are also delayed .\\nif traveling from the opposite direction , there is a significant rise in late - night wakefulness observed following a morning light pulse ( ie , traveling eastward ) , which has phase advancing effects on the sleep  wake cycle,61,62 but these effects are not significant in all studies.60 together , these data suggest that there are specific jet lag effects also experienced from short - term travel , and these can best be treated by keeping to one s home schedule and avoiding light during the times when their circadian clocks could be reset ( ie , during the subjective night , based on schedules before travel ) .\\nbright light alters subjective alertness during the day.63 these effects are likely independent of shifting the circadian clock , as they occur during the day s  dead zone  in which light has minimal effects on the circadian clock . during the night ,\\nwhen light would also affect process c , blue light reduces swa earlier in the nrem - rem ultradian cycle and increases swa later , at the expense of less rem sleep.63 there are more power density changes following blue rather than green light pulses , suggesting that the melanopsin pathway might be mediating these effects , which are specific but small .\\nsimilar specific effects are seen with polychromatic light.64 rem sleep shows some particular alterations to jet lag . in rats , there is an immediate increase in rem the night following an 8-hour advancement in the light - dark cycle ( simulating travel from los angeles to paris).65 this could be due to a rebound from rem loss during the initial schedule shift , or it could result from a shift of rem timing to earlier in the evening . in humans , melatonin taken in the early evening , which has clock - shifting effects similar to light exposure in the early morning ( eastward travel ) , rem duration increases independently of changes in nrem sleep.66 when traveling in the opposite direction and the clock is delayed , there is an increase in rem sleep latency.67 this effect could be due to an increase in swa and other components of nrem sleep that are associated with rebound to sleep deprivation , and rem might later show a compensatory rebound on subsequent nights .\\nan alternative explanation is that rem sleep has also been delayed to appear later in the evening because of a delay in the clock itself.58 there are also examples of other neurological effects of jet lag .\\nfor instance , jet lag has been associated with more frequent sleep paralysis ( lack of muscle control after arousal from sleep ) episodes.68 the physiological prerequisite for sleep paralysis is sleep onset rem , and sleep onset rem results from elevated rem sleep pressure ( a homeostatic process involved in rem regulation).69 these trends support a model where jet lag induces an initial increase in nrem sleep immediately following travel independently of shifting process c. this increase in nrem sleep suppresses rem sleep initially , but eventually it triggers a compensatory rem sleep rebound.58 during this rebound , rem pressure is increased , as is the associated frequency of sleep paralysis .\\nin contrast to sleep paralysis , seizures are known to be more prevalent during the night , predominantly during nrem sleep.70 the incidence of seizures has also been shown to increase following transmeridian travel.71 this again could be accounted for by an increase in nrem sleep from the sleep deprivation accompanying jet lag .\\nthere are a number of pathophysiological conditions associated with arousal state and sleep quality , and there is evidence to support the effective clinical application of circadian and sleep - based therapies in such cases .\\nfor example , in alzheimer disease , patients in a hospital setting where light levels are often out phase or continuously inconsistent with normal ambient lighting experience a phenomenon called  sundowning  , in which they exhibit periods of confusion and mania during the subjective rest phase.72 there is also evidence linking different forms of depression to phase misalignments of the sleep \\nwake cycle , and sleep deprivation has been shown to be effective in short - term amelioration of some depressive symptoms.73 furthermore , restoring disrupted behavioral circadian rhythms by hypnotic drugs reduces some of the symptoms of cognitive decline found in an animal model of huntington disease.74 these studies and trends suggest that circadian synchrony of the sleep \\na growing body of evidence suggests that the circadian system is an important therapeutic target , and this idea is starting to gain acceptance outside of the academic chronobiological community.75 treatment for jet lag focuses on aligning the circadian system to the appropriate environment .\\nwhen three or less time zones have been crossed , the symptoms of jet lag will persist only a short time , and the treatment strategy is better suited for fatigue associated with travel , which does not involve any major shifts in the clock itself.33 also , treating an individual to resynchronize to a new environment for only 12 days requires a number of phase shifts that will only be undone when traveling again , and so in cases of the short term , it is best to assume a temporal schedule in the new environment as close as possible to one s home schedule . since light is the major signal that shifts the sleep \\nif sleep is needed for a short - term trip , mild doses of prescription hypnotics can be helpful .\\nzolpidem ( 10 mg ) given for 3 consecutive nights starting with the first night sleep after travel has been shown to improve sleep in some seasoned travelers.76 the wake - promoting agent armodafinil ( the longer acting r - isomer of modafinil ) is also being considered for use in the treatment of jet lag sleep disorder .\\nstrictly treating the symptoms of jet lag ( ie , treating only insomnia and/or sleepiness ) does not necessarily treat jet lag itself .\\nin fact , one must take care not to further shift the clock in the wrong direction when treating the symptoms of jet lag .\\nfor instance , while a traveler may have caffeine for its arousal - promoting effects , the use of caffeine close to the time of sleep onset will result in difficulty falling or maintaining sleep.77 this often leads to exposure to light during the subjective night , which will further shift the clock out of phase with the new ambient light - dark cycle , resulting in further desynchrony . in order to avoid such a scenario ,\\nthis involves utilizing the prc to time one s exposure and avoidance of light and other resetting cues . in treating jet lag , re - entraining the sleep \\nwake cycle involves shifting the core body temperature minimum back to nighttime in the new environment through appropriately timed cues.32 the most effective time to begin treatment is prior to travel . shifting without major insomnia or sleepiness is best achieved gradually , and so timed exposure to bright light a couple of hours later than normal along with a progressively later bedtime will help phase delay the clock beginning a couple of days before taking a large westbound journey.32 the opposite is true for an eastbound journey , with an emphasis placed on exposure to light earlier in the morning when waking up to shift the clock forward.32 in general , it takes more time to adjust to a phase advance than delay ( or traveling eastward compared with westward ) .\\nwhen phase advances are sufficiently large ( > 8 hours ) , it might be easier and faster to delay the clock until synchronized with the new environment .\\nmammalian photoreception and phase shifting to light are optimized for environmental lighting conditions , which are generally much stronger than that of room lighting .\\nlight boxes have been effective in providing strong enough light directly to the eye to induce phase shifts , but this is not the case for all room lighting , especially when they are dimly lit .\\ntherefore , the best source of phase shifting light is sunlight , followed by light from a light box .\\nlight should contain wavelengths in the blue range , as this is where the photosensitive circadian system is responsive.78 during times when light should be avoided ( morning for a delay , evening for an advance ) , minimizing light exposure by drawing curtains , wearing sunglasses , using low - intensity room lighting , etc .\\nif a number of time zones are crossed during travel , light exposure schedules on the fight should be timed to maintain that the core body temperature minimum coincides with nighttime in the new environment.33 in presentation to the patient , one usually describes such strategies of light exposure in terms of going to bed earlier or later , rather than shifting rhythms .\\nhowever , it is important to understand that the act of going to sleep itself contributes to a phase shift mostly by altering activity levels and avoiding light rather than by resetting the clock .\\nthere is data to suggest that sleep does have small phase shifting effects independent of light,79 but these are minor in comparison to those achieved by light alone .\\nthis is not to imply that treating sleep disturbance is ineffective , but in the case of jet lag , sleep disturbance is a secondary target .\\none can recover sleep loss in just 12 nights , whereas the effects of jet lag can last much longer.32 the use of hypnotic agents , which are widely used for any sleep - related disturbance , including jet lag , may only mask the symptoms of jet lag .\\nthe phase shifting effects of most currently prescribed hypnotics are unknown , and even if hypnotics are used , light exposure times should be concurrently regulated .\\nmelatonin is the primary pharmacological agent used in the treatment of jet lag , and it is widely available in nonperscription form in the united states .\\nthere are also newly developed receptor specific subtype agonists that are available for prescription use , and these are thought to directly act on the scn with higher specificity .\\nlike in the case of light , there is a prc for melatonin that is necessary to utilize for its effective use in treating jet lag .\\nonly appropriately timed melatonin has phase shifting effects , even though larger doses of melatonin can have sleep - inducing effects independently of changes in the clock.80 in a simplified view , the prc for melatonin appears to be almost 180 out of phase with that of light : melatonin during the early evening phase advances the clock , whereas melatonin during the morning delays it .\\nthe dead zone for exogenous melatonin efficacy in phase shifts is during the period just prior to bedtime , when melatonin levels normally increase under low lighting conditions.33 this endogenous rise is thought to contribute to feelings of sleepiness via a mechanism that involves increased vasodilation and lowering core body temperature.51 under normally entrained conditions , endogenous melatonin synthesis is inhibited by light , and so its phase shifting effects during the early evening and morning hours are diminished .\\ndifferent doses of melatonin have slightly different prcs , and only higher doses ( 3 mg vs 0.5 mg ) have been reported to have direct hypnotic effects.32 there are also higher magnitude shifts reported for the higher dose of melatonin.32 if taking melatonin during the day when sleepiness is ideally avoided and cognitive function needs to be optimal , it is best to take a lower dose .\\nmelatonin by itself can be a potent chronobiotic , but the strongest phase shifting effects will be achieved when taken in concert with appropriately timed light exposure .\\nfor instance , in a phase delaying example , the traveler can take a low dose of melatonin and avoid light in the morning of the new time zone , and for phase advancing , melatonin should be taken in the early evening again with the avoidance of subsequent light .\\nfor instance , as discussed earlier , sleep is regulated by a circadian process along with a homeostatic process and can be modulated by different environmental conditions .\\nfeeding behavior , as another example , is also regulated by a circadian process , but feeding is also regulated by food availability , social cues , appetite , etc .\\nalthough all of these rhythms become desynchronized to differing extents during jet lag , most treatment strategies focus only on resetting of the central pacemaker in the scn .\\nthis is because inherent in most study designs , the phase of the clock is determined by core body temperature and melatonin onset , two events tightly regulated by the master clock itself .\\nthere is only a limited understanding of how other cues locally affect the resetting of tissues and organ systems .\\nthis is an important area of future research , as rhythms are now understood to be the result of multidirectional communicating networks .\\ntwo other areas in which phase shifting might be important for synchronization of events downstream of the master clock are exercise and timed feeding .\\nanimal studies suggest that appropriately timed exercise contributes to recovery from jet lag . in humans ,\\nthe data are much less consistent , but this could be due to the fact that the effects of exercise on phase shifting might exist primarily outside of the scn . furthermore , the appropriate intensity and timing of this exercise has yet to be determined in something like a consensus prc .\\nfrom what is known , however , the appropriate timing of moderate exercise appears similar to that of exogenous melatonin : exercise in the morning phase delays , and exercise in the evening phase advances.81 there is one major exception , though , involving a study showing that exercise at night in humans induces phase delays.82 it could be that in all cases , exercise promotes fatigue , napping , or some other altered form of time in bed . the phase shifting effects of exercise on the master clock are relatively low in magnitude , but in concert with other phase shifting paradigms , the effects can be additive .\\nit is still unknown whether or not exercise accelerates phase shifts in other brain areas or other clock networks in the body . for treatment purposes , drastically changing an exercise routine for treatment of jet lag is best avoided while the literature sorts itself out .\\nanother area where individuals can behaviorally accelerate realignment to the environment is through appropriately timed feeding .\\nthere has been a recent explosion of research in the field of food - entrainable oscillations , which are important for proper metabolism and also in synchronizing rest and activity rhythms.83 clock genes cycle robustly throughout the liver and the entire gi tract , and there is a normal circadian variation in gut motility that needs to be tightly regulated to maintain the sequential contraction of smooth muscle to push food and nutrients through the gut.84,85 peripheral clocks also show a hierarchical control in the circadian system , suggesting that there is some plasticity in control of synchronization at different levels of the body.86 data from animals also suggest that the scn and peripheral organs adjust to new environmental cycles at different rates , as peripheral organs appear to take longer to reset than the scn.87 this further contributes to the desynchrony within the body that accounts for the symptoms of jet lag .\\nthere is a noticeable lack of data on how feeding schedules can be used to re - entrain following a phase shift in humans .\\nironically , one of the major complaints following jet lag is bowel movement irregularity.88 one study on jet lag had suggested that a diet of high protein early in the day and high in carbohydrates later in the day accelerated a phase shift with military personnel , but this data has not been confirmed on a large scale , nor is the treatment necessarily feasible for everyone.89 regardless , a common sense approach to appropriately timed feeding is to gradually adjust meals to the new time schedule and avoid things like coffee and alcohol as they will interfere with quality of sleep and thus complicate the re - entrainment process .\\njet lag is a relatively common form of circadian disruption occurring when the core circadian system is out of synchrony with the environment due to the rapid shift of the light - dark cycle . during jet lag ,\\nthe various oscillatory components of the circadian system are likely out of phase with the central clock in the scn and consequently with each other .\\nthis disorganization of the circadian system leads to a cluster of symptoms including sleep disturbances and suboptimal cognitive performance . for short trips\\n, we would recommend accommodating to this biological challenge by appropriate scheduling , ie , avoid early light exposure after newly arriving after an eastward fight or avoid nighttime light exposure after westward travel .\\nin addition , proper sleep hygiene , including appropriate use of hypnotics , can be useful . for longer trips , synchronization to the new time zone can be aided by a variety of manipulations including timed light - exposure , melatonin , exercise , and timed meals .\\nimportantly , the goal of shifting one s clock should not be complicated by treating only sleep disturbances .\\nprcs should be used when available , but generally travelers can appropriately time light and melatonin if they expose themselves to light in the early morning and take melatonin in the late afternoon when traveling eastward , and by exposing themselves to light in the early evening and taking melatonin in the morning when traveling westward . as we have come to understand that an observable rhythm results from the interactions of many endogenously generated rhythms and environmental factors , treatment for jet lag - like sleep disorders should be multifaceted .\\nthese widely accepted clinical treatment strategies involving light , melatonin , and other nonphotic cues have been shown effective when appropriately timed , and future research with an improved understanding of circadian misalignment will undoubtedly be beneficial in continuing to link the appropriate timing of sleep and wake cycles to improved health and well being .\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n

acii , bstui , hpaii , and hinp1i ) to assess 5-lox dna methylation in brain and heart tissue samples from young ( 2 months ) and old ( 22 months ) mice . \\n we also measured mrna content for 5-lox and the dna methyltransferases dnmt1 and dnmt3a . \\n in young mice , the 5-lox mrna content was significantly greater in the heart compared to the brain ; 5-lox dna methylation was lower , except in the acii assay in which it was higher in the heart . \\n aging decreased 5-lox mrna content in the heart and increased it in the brain . \\n aging also increased 5-lox dna methylation and this effect was site- ( i.e. , enzyme ) and tissue - specific . generally , \\n dnmt1 and dnmt3a mrna content was lower in the brain regions compared to the heart ; the only effect of aging was observed in the mrna content of dnmt3a , which was decreased in the heart of old mice . \\n these results indicate a complex tissue - specific and aging - dependent interplay between the dna methylation system and 5-lox mrna content . \\n interpretation of this data must take into account that the tissue samples contained a mixture of various cell types . \",\n          \" introductionthe purpose of the present review is to review our experience with near - infrared spectroscopy ( nirs ) monitoring in shock resuscitation and predicting clinical outcomes.methodsthe management of critically ill patients with goal - oriented intensive care unit ( icu ) resuscitation continues to evolve as our understanding of the appropriate physiologic targets improves . \\n it is now recognized that resuscitation to achieve supranormal indices is not beneficial in all patients and may precipitate abdominal compartment syndrome.resultsover the years , icu technology has provided physicians with specific physiologic parameters to guide shock resuscitation . throughout this time , the tissue hemoglobin oxygen saturation ( sto2 ) monitor has emerged as a non - invasive means to obtain reliable physiologic parameters to guide clinicians ' resuscitative efforts . \\n sto2 monitors have been shown to aid in early identification of nonresponders and to predict outcomes in hemorrhagic shock and icu resuscitation . \\n these data have also been used to better understand and refine existing resuscitation protocols . \\n more recently , use of nirs technology to guide resuscitation in septic shock has been shown to predict outcomes in high - risk patients.conclusionssto2 is an important tool in identifying high - risk patients in septic and hemorrhagic shock . \\n it is a non - invasive means of obtaining vital information regarding outcome and adequacy of resuscitation . \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n

given her non - responsiveness to the treatment , she was readmitted to the hospital .\\nthe patient was previously healthy and newly married , with no prior history of diseases or drug consumption .\\nshe was lethargic , though hemodynamically stable according to physical examinations , and her body mass index ( bmi ) was 17 kg / m at the admission time .\\nthe significant observation was a mobile mass ( 2  1 cm ) with soft consistency behind the left sternocleidomastoid in left cervical , axillary and inguinal lymph nodes ; no redness or warmth was reported in the mass .\\near , nose , and throat checkups showed normal results and the patient had no complaints of abdominal pain , lower limb pain , or diarrhea .\\nin addition , no facial or body skin rash was reported and other findings were normal . in para - clinical evaluations , the results of chest radiograph , chest ct scan , electrocardiogram and echocardiography were normal . moreover , in pelvic and abdominal ultrasounds , no abnormalities were observed except for the enlargement of the spleen . in the patient s initial blood test , white blood cell ( wbc ) count of 2000  \\ncells / mm and the presence of 1% atypical lymphocytes with an increase in immature neutrophils ( bands ) , hemoglobin of 11.3   g / dl and a mild thrombocytopenia , as well as high alkaline phosphatase , high c - reactive protein , and an erythrocyte sedimentation rate ( esr ) of 48 were reported .\\nblood tests and examinations of urine and stool samples were all negative . the results of sputum acid - fast bacilli culture and antinuclear antibody test were negative , as well .\\nsimilarly , the results of autoimmune screening , as well as toxoplasma and cytomegalovirus tests were negative .\\nmacroscopic examination of the lymph node capsule showed a creamy grey - colored mass with soft consistency , homogeneity , and a dimension of 0.5  1  2 cm . in the microscopic study ( at low magnification ) , partial effacement of the lymph node structure and pale patchy infiltrates were reported .\\nat the center of the lesion , an extensive coagulative necrosis composed of cellular debris and free of neutrophilic or eosinophilic infiltrates was observed ( figures 1 and 2 ) . finally , the kikuchi s disease was diagnosed based on the findings . considering the improved symptoms of the patient after two weeks of hospitalization , she was discharged from the hospital in good general health and received anti - inflammatory medications .\\ngiven the improvements in her symptoms , the medications were gradually discontinued and she started to be followed up on a monthly basis . during the 8-year follow - up of the patient , except for the mean sublingual temperature of 37.8c which was reported once or twice a year ( continuing for a couple of days ) , no other significant findings were reported .\\nthe patient was in good general health during the follow - up and her examination results were normal .\\nthe patient had two healthy pregnancies in 2010 and 2012 and was in a good general condition during her pregnancies and lactation . in august 2014 ,\\nthe patient was referred to the hospital with high fever , night sweats , weight loss and anorexia ( bmi = 16\\nafter a one - month delay , painful generalized lymphadenopathy in left cervical , axillary and inguinal lymph nodes with soft consistency and mobility was reported ; however , no redness or warmth was reported in the mass . in the second blood test , neither leukopenia nor high esr was observed . the results of chest radiography as well as those of abdominal and pelvic ultrasounds were normal .\\nconsidering the patient s unwillingness to undergo repeated biopsy , she underwent a corticosteroid regimen .\\nafter three months of using prednisone , the patient s fever subsided and her lymphadenopathy was impalpable .\\nkfd , also known as hnl , is a self - limiting condition , causing lymphadenopathy .\\nthis disease is most commonly observed in adults younger than 40 years of age , with a female predominance in previous studies ( 3 ) .\\nother less commonly reported presentations include leukopenia , atypical lymphocytes on peripheral smear , liver dysfunction , bone marrow involvement , fatigue , hepatosplenomegaly , and skin rash ( 2 ) .\\nalthough the disease is characterized by regional lymphadenopathy , few patients show generalized lymphadenopathy . in the present case\\n, there was simultaneous involvement of cervical lymph nodes with axillary and inguinal lymph nodes together with uncommon symptoms including leukopenia , severe weight loss and splenomegaly , indicating a generalized lymphoma which often leads to a misdiagnosis .\\na definite diagnosis of kfd may be made only via histopathological analysis by open lymph node biopsy ( 1 ) .\\nthere is no specific treatment for kfd , although in severe cases , the use of corticosteroids has been recommended for the prevention of fatal complications ( 1 ) .\\nthe signs and symptoms of kfd usually resolve after several months ( 1 , 2 ) . in a review of cases with kfd by kucukardali et al .\\nin addition , a low recurrence rate ( 3 - 4% ) has been reported in previous studies ( 1 , 2 ) .\\npatients with recurrent episodes are more likely to present fever , cough , and fatigue , along with frequent extranodal involvement in the initial presentation ( 7 ) . in comparison with previous studies ,\\nher disease was complicated by the return of symptoms eight years after the initial diagnosis , with symptoms such as fever , fatigue , severe weight loss and generalized lymphadenopathy . in the present case ,\\na definite diagnosis of kfd is made by tissue biopsy , particularly whole lymph node biopsy ( 4 , 5 ) . in the present case ,\\nthe diagnosis of hnl was confirmed according to the results from the pathological slices ; also , there is a chance that more severe cases get included with pathological confirmation , while mild cases get excluded due to follow - up loss .\\nalthough the etiology of kfd recurrence is unknown , certain viral infections including epstein - barr ( eb ) virus , parvovirus b19 and human herpesvirus-8 have been hypothesized to be among the triggers for kfd relapse ( 8) . as stephan et al\\n. indicated , the recurrence of hnl is associated with the persistence of eb virus infections ( 9 ) . in addition , atarashi et al . , reported a case of recurrent hnl in a human t - lymphotropic virus type i carrier . in the present case , infectious etiologies including eb virus , cytomegalovirus and hiv were all negative ( 10 ) .\\nit is unknown whether other viral infections were associated with hnl in the present case .\\nas evidence suggests , kfd may be a precursor for systemic lupus erythematosus ( sle ) , as both conditions have concurrent , coexisting patterns in patients ( 11 ) .\\ncheng et al . , described the clinical manifestations and outcomes of 195 patients diagnosed with hnl . in the mentioned study ,\\na total of 14 out of 96 patients ( 14.6% ) had recurrent hnl and five of them developed autoimmune diseases such as sle ( 12 ) .\\nit seems that individuals with hnl are more susceptible to sle ; thus , they should be routinely screened for this disorder ( 2 ) . with the results of the present study ,\\nit is important to differentiate kfd from other conditions ; in this case , it can inhibit adverse drug reactions in patients and prevent empirical treatments , especially with antibiotics that impose financial burdens on families . in conclusion , although kfd is an uncommon condition , it should be featured in the list of differential diagnoses of tender lymphadenopathy , especially lymphadenopathy localized to the cervical region .\\nhowever , although the disease takes a self - limiting clinical course in most cases , we reported a case of kfd with a prolonged relapse of eight years . full recovery with a good response to corticosteroid regimen was achieved after the recurrence ; therefore , considering the recurrence of kfd , long - term follow - up of patients with kfd is necessary .\",\n          \"muscle contraction produces force and change in the muscle s length , i.e. , velocity .\\nskeletal muscles are primarily classified into parallel muscles and \\n pennate muscles , based on the muscle s form and structure . in parallel muscles , the \\n shortening velocity is faster and the range of motion is larger because the muscle fibers \\n are arranged longitudinally and directly reflect mechanical shortening .\\nin contrast , in \\n pennate muscles , the shortening velocity is slower and the range of motion is shorter \\n because muscle fibers are arranged diagonally with a certain pennate angle .\\npennate muscles \\n exert stronger force because they comprise a greater number of muscle fibers , with a larger \\n cross - sectional area .\\ngenerally , parallel muscles are located at joints , such as the elbow \\n joint , and require exercise to change the joint angle significantly .\\nconversely , many \\n pennate muscles are located in the lower extremities and counteract the effects of \\n gravity2 , 3 .\\nthe semitendinosus muscle ( st ) composes a part of the hamstrings and has a characteristic \\n form ( fig .\\n1.structure of the semitendinosus musclethe line of tendinous inscription ( arrow 1 ) lies at the center of the muscle belly . \\n\\nthe proximal compartment has the \\n structure of a parallel muscle , whereas the distal compartment is considered a pennate \\n muscle because it has a pennate angle ( arrow 2 ; recorded at 65% from the proximal \\n tendon ) . ) .\\nthe st has a tendinous inscription ( ti ) in the center of the muscle belly , and its \\n muscle fibers are divided into a proximal compartment ( pc ) and a distal compartment ( dc ) . \\n\\nthe pc of the st is a parallel muscle , but the dc has a pennate structure with an average \\n 12.9 pennate angle4 . in other words ,\\nthe \\n st comprises both parallel and pennate muscles dependent on the existence of the ti . \\n\\nfunctional differences can therefore be assumed between the two compartments , because each \\n has a unique innervation5 , 6 .\\nstructure of the semitendinosus muscle the line of tendinous inscription ( arrow 1 ) lies at the center of the muscle belly . \\n\\nthe proximal compartment has the \\n structure of a parallel muscle , whereas the distal compartment is considered a pennate \\n muscle because it has a pennate angle ( arrow 2 ; recorded at 65% from the proximal \\n tendon ) .\\nreportedly , the st is susceptible to injury in the dc on the sports field7 .\\nit is believed that the muscle fibers are \\n particularly easily injured during eccentric contraction because they can not withstand \\n elongation due to the load3 , 8 .\\nfor example , the dc is often damaged during the swing phase \\n of running .\\nweakness of the hamstring muscles was predicted to underlie this damage9,10,11 , and hamstring strengthening exercises \\n have been proposed as a precaution12 , 13 .\\nalso , the increase in stiffness of the \\n hamstrings may serve as a cause of shoulder and elbow pain14 and decrease of dynamic postural control15 .\\nalthough there are many reports on the injury of the dc \\n and on the treatment of stiffness of the hamstrings16 , 17 , few studies have \\n considered the difference between the pc and dc . in the context of our clinical rehabilitation for patients who have undergone total knee \\n arthroplasty , it was observed that flexibility of the dc of the st is lost , but not that of \\n the pc .\\nit was also observed that muscle force or \\n range of motion in the knee joint increases with improved flexibility of the dc .\\nhowever , \\n this is difficult to prove clinically because the st has a complex form .\\ntherefore , it is important to determine the functional differences between the pc and dc of \\n the st . in this study , using an ultrasound device , muscle fiber lengths in each compartment \\n of the st were measured during knee flexion and hip extension to determine the functional \\n differences between the dc and pc as well as changes in joint angle .\\nthe left legs of seven men aged 2138 years , without orthopedic or neurological system \\n disorders were examined . after the purpose of this study was explained to them , all of them \\n provided written informed consent in order to participate .\\nall procedures in this study were \\n approved by our institutional ethics committee ( no . 39 - 2 ) .\\nthe participants performed knee flexion ( kf ) and hip extension ( he ) movements in the prone \\n position , with 0 extension of the knee joint and 25 flexion of the hip joint .\\nkf was defined as a flexion movement \\n from about 0 to 80 knee flexion at 25 hip flexion .\\nhe was defined as an extension \\n movement from about 25 to 0 hip flexion at 0 knee flexion .\\nthese movement angles were \\n selected with reference to those that occur during normal walking and because of the ease of \\n the movements .\\nparticipants performed one movement every 4 seconds with the aid of an \\n electric metronome .\\nthe ti of the st was recorded at least twice , and the pennate part was \\n recorded at least three times ( fig .\\nthere were two movements and two recorded parts . in each movement \\n ( knee flexion and hip extension ) , the tendinous inscription and pennate parts were \\n recorded at different times.b .\\nultrasound images were recorded at the tendinous inscription part and \\n distal pennate part , during two movements , for each subject ( a ) .\\nthe knee and hip joints \\n angles were recorded using a video camera , in synchrony with the ultrasound images \\n ( c ) .\\nthe ultrasound ( a ) and joint angle ( b ) images were analyzed using dartfish \\n animation software ( c ) . ;

that our bodies are persistent in how they keep track of time .\\nthis timekeeping system structures the different physiological processes to work together over the course of the day in synchrony with the physical world .\\nthe master network coordinating this timing system is based in the suprachiasmatic nucleus ( scn ) of the hypothalamus , where neurons exhibit circadian ( lit .  about a day  ) rhythms in their electrical activity and are driven by cell - autonomous molecular feedback loops.1 these neural activity rhythms are critical for circadian output and are reciprocally required for the sustained generation of their own internal molecular oscillations .\\noutput from this scn clock regulates oscillatory sleep and arousal control centers , leading downstream to the organization of our daily sleep \\nwake behavior ( figure 1 ) . during jet lag , a rapid shift in the sleep \\nwake cycle transiently disrupts this coordinated regulation , and ( 1 ) the clock network loses synchrony with the external environment and ( 2 ) the many oscillators within our bodies become desynchronized with each other .\\ntemporary circadian desynchronization has many effects , but the most obvious are impaired sleep at night and excessive daytime sleepiness during the day , which bring patients to the attention of the sleep clinician .\\nthis article provides a framework for understanding the biological basis of jet lag and for recommending management strategies .\\nunderstanding jet lag can help us address the broader problem of circadian misalignment , which has increasingly been associated with increased risk for cancer , metabolic disease , cardiovascular dysfunction , mood disorders , and cognitive decline.24\\nalthough there have been a number of attempts to model the processes that regulate the sleep \\nwake cycle , the two - process model of sleep regulation has had the most widespread acceptance across the chronobiological community ( figure 2 ) . in the simplest terms\\n, this model proposes that sleep propensity is governed by two predominant , sometimes competing processes : one being a homeostatic load accumulated of sleep need based on time since last sleep episode , termed \\nprocess s  , and another being a circadian - controlled rhythm in wakefulness or sleep , termed  process c.57 the two major processes governing basal sleep organization keep track of time but can be thought of very differently : the circadian component , process c , is an oscillator that runs indefinitely and consistently to dictate the time at which events occur , whereas the process regulating homeostatic sleep ( process s ) operates like an hourglass which tells intervals of time .\\nsleep and wake behaviors are the sum result of several oscillatory and hourglass processes acting together in concert with external signals that regulate their precise initiation , termination , and duration , but for the sake of modeling , their regulatory components have been simplified and reduced to process s and process c.8,9\\nalthough sleep itself is a behavior , in humans and some animal models , we can quantify different properties of sleep by measuring cortical activity with the electroencephalogram ( eeg ) .\\neeg recordings have been useful in parsing levels of arousal and sleep , such as rapid eye movement ( rem ) and nonrapid eye movement ( nrem ) , and also in relating certain electrophysiological correlates with other parameters related to sleep and wake states .\\nevidence suggests that delta power or slow - wave activity ( swa ) during nrem sleep can be used to estimate process s , as delta power increases logarithmically as waking is prolonged.5,6 conversely , core body temperature is often used as a measure of process c , as it is relatively free from masking by movement artifacts and itself is a robust rhythm .\\nsleep propensity is greatest during the falling limb of the circadian body temperature rhythm and decreases on the rising limb.10 there have been different hypotheses presented as to how specifically the circadian pacemaker dictates sleep  wake behavior at a physiological level.1113 although there is no definitive consensus , data support a model by which process c actively promotes different aspects of each behavioral state rather than passively gating state transitions.14 at an additional level of temporal regulation , kleitman15 proposed that humans followed a basic rest activity cycle ( brac ) that exhibits an ultradian rhythm .\\nrem sleep cycles through the course of the night , and ultradian rhythms in alertness during the course of the day with a similar period\\nwake rhythm could be a series of thresholds set by ultradian variations coupled to circadian variations .\\nthus during certain times of the day , the circadian system promotes cycling levels of arousal , whereas during other times , it promotes cycling through different stages of sleep .\\ninterestingly , there are certain aspects of sleep that appear to be strongly regulated by the circadian system that incorporate this organization .\\nboth human and animal studies have shown that there are circadian rhythms regulating arousal and rem sleep , but nrem sleep appears to be more strongly under the control of a sleep homeostatic drive.9,14 in understanding how the circadian system influences sleep and wake , it is important to remember that process c is one of many oscillatory processes , distinguishable from other oscillatory processes in the circadian system , but sharing a common point of origin .\\njet lag and other disruptions in process c may be the result of perturbations in the circadian input pathway , the master oscillatory network in the scn of the hypothalamus that organizes the body s clocks , or in the specific outputs along the sleep \\nin mammals , the part of the nervous system responsible for the organization of circadian behavior lies in a paired structure in the hypothalamus known as the scn .\\nalthough other cells in the body show oscillatory properties , the clock within the scn is considered the master oscillator that coordinates daily rhythms.1 the scn is a bilaterally paired nucleus made up of tightly compacted , small - diameter neurons just lateral to the third ventricle atop the optic chiasm .\\nsubcortical light information is transmitted directly to the scn via the retinohypothalamic tract ( figure 1 ) , whereas thalamic and midbrain inputs modulate light information and transmit nonphotic signals.16 the scn integrates this environmental information and modifies the oscillatory activity of its neurons to create coherent , robust , neural , and humoral signals to the rest of the brain and periphery.17 the neural outputs of the scn largely travel to other hypothalamic regions including the subparaventricular zone and the dorsomedial nucleus.1820 these hypothalamic relay nuclei send projections throughout the central nervous system and endocrine system , providing multiple pathways by which the scn can convey temporal information to a diffuse network of sleep and arousal - promoting centers.21,22 interestingly , this communication appears to be bidirectional , as sleep state information is communicated back to the scn as well.23 the expression of behavioral rhythms involves a far more complex route than a linear pathway from a single scn neuron to sleep  wake activity .\\nanimal studies have indicated that part of the scn is primarily involved in spontaneous rhythm generation , whereas the other part is primarily involved in conveying environmental resetting signals back to the rhythm generating neurons.24 downstream of the scn , structures receiving temporal cues from the scn have to incorporate this temporal information among a vast network of other inputs . to make matters more complex , other neurons and cells throughout the body show endogenous oscillations themselves in transcriptional activity of clock genes.4 thus , the scn exerts its actions on other clock - like systems throughout the body rather than just by amplifying its own timekeeping signal as the body s only rhythm . in sleep ,\\nthe scn signal is integrated across sleep and wake - control centers , and activity specific to this pathway generates the rhythms observed in process c. under certain experimental conditions , process c can be uncoupled from other oscillations that utilize separate neural pathways.18,25 scn lesion studies in animals have primarily been used to model sleep  wake regulation in the absence of process c. in addition to exhibiting arrhythmicity in the timing of the sleep \\nwake cycle , some studies show that scn - lesioned animals will sleep the same amount over a 24-hour period , but this will be expressed in a fragmented ultradian rhythm over the course of the day.26,27 there are studies to suggest that total sleep time also increases after lesioning , but this might be a species - specific phenomenon.12,13 although rebound in response to sleep deprivation is relatively similar in the absence of the scn,26 the appropriate timing of this rebound is disrupted .\\nanimal studies have also shown that rem sleep appears to be highly regulated by the circadian system.25 studies of lesioned rats showed that transitions into rem sleep are facilitated by the scn during the rest phase , but the amount of rem sleep , once initiated , is determined primarily by homeostatic mechanisms.28 there are distinctly robust contributions of process c to arousal , rem sleep , and sleep consolidation.14 the role of process c in both arousal and rem sleep may be explained by the previously described brac model in which there is a strong circadian regulation of the similar cortical activity accompanying wakefulness and rem sleep .\\nthere is a very short and specific window , related in phase to the endogenous body temperature rhythm ( as it approaches its daily minimum ) , in which one may fall asleep and maintain this state throughout the night.14 one explanation for this is that the circadian sleep  wake signal might be suppressing a drive toward arousal during the second half of a sleep period.10,14 in insomnia , this drive might be insufficient , ultimately leading to inappropriately timed wakefulness.29 the misalignment of the core body temperature minimum with the light - dark cycle is a major target for the treatment of jet lag - like desynchrony .\\ncircadian rhythms of both nocturnal and diurnal mammals are most sensitive to light resetting during the night .\\nalthough there are other , nonphotic means to resetting the clock , light has been shown to be the most robust.30 a low intensity pulse of 180 lux light ( typical office lighting ) that is appropriately timed is sufficient to significantly reset circadian rhythms in humans.31 the direction and magnitude of light resetting depend on the endogenous phase of the clock , and this relationship is summarized in the form of a phase response curve ( prc ) . although light - based prcs have been extensively researched and documented,32,33 they all suggest the same basic pattern : in the first part of the night , light delays circadian rhythms .\\nin contrast , light exposure during the later part of the night or early morning advances rhythms to an earlier phase , resulting in earlier bedtime and waking up earlier in the morning .\\nthe point at which a light cue switches its effects on the clock from delaying to advancing is around the core body temperature minimum , a time during which feelings of subjective sleepiness are strongest.32 in the middle of the subjective day , when one is normally exposed to high levels of ambient light , there is little to no shifting effect of light on circadian rhythms .\\nit is difficult to examine light effects on sleep independently of circadian rhythms as light has arousing effects that can  mask  rhythms in activity without resetting the circadian clock.34 light affects sleep both through process c and concurrently through other mechanisms , namely midbrain arousal circuits and hormonal signaling , which , like circadian rhythms , are directly connected to the non - image - forming visual system.35,36 light reaches the scn directly via a projection of intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cell axons that contain the recently discovered photopigment melanopsin ( figure 1).36,37 this pigment is most sensitive to light in the blue wavelength range38 and is necessary for normal resetting of behavioral rhythms in animals following alterations in their light - dark cycle.3941 human circadian rhythms are most sensitive to resetting at light wavelengths around 460 nm , which coincides with the photoresponsive range of melanopsin.42 interestingly , melanopsin - containing neurons not only project to the scn , but also to the pretectum,36 where light acts independently of the circadian system to acutely induce sleep in nocturnal mammals during their active phase.43 melanopsin knockout mice fail to sleep during a nighttime light pulse and show less total sleep time and swa following sleep deprivation.44 thus this photoreceptive pathway affects sleep both dependent and independent of process c through multiple targets .\\nmany scn efferents are routed through the paraventricular hypothalamus , which signals to the autonomic intermediolateral cell column of the spinal cord , and eventually to the pineal gland to produce the nocturnal hormone melatonin.45 melatonin is carried throughout the body with targets in both the brain and periphery , it exhibits a robust circadian rhythm , and it is synthesized in the pineal gland in the absence of light.46 melatonin receptors are strongly expressed in the scn , and melatonin is thought to feedback to the scn to modulate its rhythmic profile.46 interestingly , the scn has been shown to be important for both the circadian rhythm in melatonin synthesis as well as the light - induced suppression of melatonin.47 although the scn is implicated in both pathways , different subregions have been mapped out for each effect on melatonin ( circadian vs acute).48 this would suggest that at least some environmental information that resets the clock does so downstream of the master oscillator in the scn .\\nalthough in mammals melatonin is not necessary for the expression of behavioral rhythmicity , it is necessary in birds and reptiles.49 in humans , increases in melatonin at the appropriate circadian phase are associated with inducing sleepiness.50 exogenous melatonin at higher doses also has this hypnotic effect , and the mechanism by which melatonin induces sleepiness may be explained by vasodilatory effects . in warm - blooded animals , melatonin is thought to adjust the setpoint at which core body temperature is regulated , thereby allowing higher blood flow to distal areas of the body and heat loss from the body s core.51 thermosensitive neurons in the distal body communicate temperature information back to the preoptic anterior hypothalamus , which contains sleep - active neurons that send inhibitory projections to arousal - promoting circuits in the brain.52 although this pathway does not by itself account for all sleep  wake regulation , it does offer one viable explanation as to the association between sleepiness and the daily core body temperature minimum .\\nwhen circadian rhythm disruptions occur , desynchrony between clock systems within an individual as well as desynchrony with the environment follows . even at the level of the scn , different subregions shift at different rates.53 in general ,\\na phase shift within the scn is relatively rapid , but in other parts of the brain and also in the periphery , it can take many days to reset rhythms .\\noutputs from the circadian clock regulate key components in physiological pathways to drive rhythms in these systems , but the molecular components of the clock in each cell can also comprise cellular pathways with additional functions , including regulating metabolism and the cycle of cell division.4 it is , therefore , important to understand the mechanisms behind desynchrony , as these disruptions not only affect temporal organization of networks , but also of the basic functions for cell survival . although symptoms of jet lag are generally temporary , they can be disruptive and include difficulty sleeping , excessive daytime sleepiness , general malaise , impaired performance , and gastrointestinal ( gi ) upset.54 the severity of jet lag symptoms and the ability to adapt to the new time zone are typically influenced by the direction of travel ( slower adaptation when traveling east ) and the number of time zones crossed.32,33 not all travelers crossing time zones suffer from jet lag to the same degree , and these differences probably result from individual variation , similar to those reported for adaptation to shift work.32 although experimentally it has been shown that circadian rhythms can be shifted by light independent of shifts in the sleep \\nit has been demonstrated , for instance , that sleep deprivation can damp the effects of a light - based phase shift,56 and that bright light , conversely , can counteract some of the eeg changes that normally accompany sleep deprivation.57 studies following transatlantic airline passengers show that there are specific , sleep quality changes altered as a result of jet lag . after an eastward journey , when the sleep  wake cycle is shifted ahead , travelers show increased difficulty in initiating sleep by the second night that continues for the next few days in the new time zone.58 this difference is not observed on the first night , suggesting that immediately following eastward travel , process s can induce sleep despite a misaligned process c , possibly due to sleep deprivation or fatigue associated with travel .\\nwhen simulating eastbound travel in the lab through advancing the time of sleep onset , there is an increase in time spent awake in the earlier part of the evening during the night of the shift.59 the results from these 2 paradigms suggest that the act of traveling itself helps promote sleep on the first night in the new environment .\\nthis travel - induced increase in sleep pressure independent of process c is supported by marked increases in stage 2 sleep on only the first night in the new time zone.58 there is interestingly a compensatory increase in rem sleep several nights later.58 changes in sleep quality after a phase delaying westward fight , in contrast , last fewer days when crossing the same number of time zones.32,58 westward bound travelers show increased swa on the first night in the new time zone , suggesting an increase in sleep pressure following travel ( much like in eastward travelers ) . simulating westbound fight in the lab , modeled by delayed sleep onset , results in an increased ( albeit nonsignificant ) trend in transitions to terminal wakefulness during the first night of the new sleep schedule as well . in both experimental paradigms\\nhowever , there is also an increase in sleep pressure that is due to an extended time since last sleep episode ( ie , an increase in process s ) . in this way\\n, westward travel is going to consistently involve an additional factor that increases sleep pressure for at least the first night following travel , as compared with eastbound travel.59 in summary , there are patterns in the changes of sleep quality following transmeridian travel that may present in the clinic . for the first day following travel , travelers are likely to fall asleep with less difficulty due to an increased sleep pressure that arises because of sleep deprivation and fatigue from traveling . if eastbound , after the first night , individuals will likely have more difficulty in initiating sleep from a few days to around a week following travel . in westward travel , there may be more difficulty in maintaining sleep later into the night , but this ( mis)alignment is often restored and sleep symptoms are greatly reduced within only a few days post travel.58 in the laboratory , timed bright light exposure in the early evening , which mimics the light resetting effects on the clock of traveling westward , results in increased time to fall asleep for 2 nights following light exposure when the timing of the sleep  wake cycle is kept constant.60 the above experimental paradigm models what might occur upon returning home after traveling westward for a short - term trip .\\nthe changes in sleep could be explained by the evening light delaying the rhythm in core body temperature , wherein the descent toward the temperature minimum is delayed and the associated sleep - related effects of this fall are also delayed .\\nif traveling from the opposite direction , there is a significant rise in late - night wakefulness observed following a morning light pulse ( ie , traveling eastward ) , which has phase advancing effects on the sleep  wake cycle,61,62 but these effects are not significant in all studies.60 together , these data suggest that there are specific jet lag effects also experienced from short - term travel , and these can best be treated by keeping to one s home schedule and avoiding light during the times when their circadian clocks could be reset ( ie , during the subjective night , based on schedules before travel ) .\\nbright light alters subjective alertness during the day.63 these effects are likely independent of shifting the circadian clock , as they occur during the day s  dead zone  in which light has minimal effects on the circadian clock . during the night ,\\nwhen light would also affect process c , blue light reduces swa earlier in the nrem - rem ultradian cycle and increases swa later , at the expense of less rem sleep.63 there are more power density changes following blue rather than green light pulses , suggesting that the melanopsin pathway might be mediating these effects , which are specific but small .\\nsimilar specific effects are seen with polychromatic light.64 rem sleep shows some particular alterations to jet lag . in rats , there is an immediate increase in rem the night following an 8-hour advancement in the light - dark cycle ( simulating travel from los angeles to paris).65 this could be due to a rebound from rem loss during the initial schedule shift , or it could result from a shift of rem timing to earlier in the evening . in humans , melatonin taken in the early evening , which has clock - shifting effects similar to light exposure in the early morning ( eastward travel ) , rem duration increases independently of changes in nrem sleep.66 when traveling in the opposite direction and the clock is delayed , there is an increase in rem sleep latency.67 this effect could be due to an increase in swa and other components of nrem sleep that are associated with rebound to sleep deprivation , and rem might later show a compensatory rebound on subsequent nights .\\nan alternative explanation is that rem sleep has also been delayed to appear later in the evening because of a delay in the clock itself.58 there are also examples of other neurological effects of jet lag .\\nfor instance , jet lag has been associated with more frequent sleep paralysis ( lack of muscle control after arousal from sleep ) episodes.68 the physiological prerequisite for sleep paralysis is sleep onset rem , and sleep onset rem results from elevated rem sleep pressure ( a homeostatic process involved in rem regulation).69 these trends support a model where jet lag induces an initial increase in nrem sleep immediately following travel independently of shifting process c. this increase in nrem sleep suppresses rem sleep initially , but eventually it triggers a compensatory rem sleep rebound.58 during this rebound , rem pressure is increased , as is the associated frequency of sleep paralysis .\\nin contrast to sleep paralysis , seizures are known to be more prevalent during the night , predominantly during nrem sleep.70 the incidence of seizures has also been shown to increase following transmeridian travel.71 this again could be accounted for by an increase in nrem sleep from the sleep deprivation accompanying jet lag .\\nthere are a number of pathophysiological conditions associated with arousal state and sleep quality , and there is evidence to support the effective clinical application of circadian and sleep - based therapies in such cases .\\nfor example , in alzheimer disease , patients in a hospital setting where light levels are often out phase or continuously inconsistent with normal ambient lighting experience a phenomenon called  sundowning  , in which they exhibit periods of confusion and mania during the subjective rest phase.72 there is also evidence linking different forms of depression to phase misalignments of the sleep \\nwake cycle , and sleep deprivation has been shown to be effective in short - term amelioration of some depressive symptoms.73 furthermore , restoring disrupted behavioral circadian rhythms by hypnotic drugs reduces some of the symptoms of cognitive decline found in an animal model of huntington disease.74 these studies and trends suggest that circadian synchrony of the sleep \\na growing body of evidence suggests that the circadian system is an important therapeutic target , and this idea is starting to gain acceptance outside of the academic chronobiological community.75 treatment for jet lag focuses on aligning the circadian system to the appropriate environment .\\nwhen three or less time zones have been crossed , the symptoms of jet lag will persist only a short time , and the treatment strategy is better suited for fatigue associated with travel , which does not involve any major shifts in the clock itself.33 also , treating an individual to resynchronize to a new environment for only 12 days requires a number of phase shifts that will only be undone when traveling again , and so in cases of the short term , it is best to assume a temporal schedule in the new environment as close as possible to one s home schedule . since light is the major signal that shifts the sleep \\nif sleep is needed for a short - term trip , mild doses of prescription hypnotics can be helpful .\\nzolpidem ( 10 mg ) given for 3 consecutive nights starting with the first night sleep after travel has been shown to improve sleep in some seasoned travelers.76 the wake - promoting agent armodafinil ( the longer acting r - isomer of modafinil ) is also being considered for use in the treatment of jet lag sleep disorder .\\nstrictly treating the symptoms of jet lag ( ie , treating only insomnia and/or sleepiness ) does not necessarily treat jet lag itself .\\nin fact , one must take care not to further shift the clock in the wrong direction when treating the symptoms of jet lag .\\nfor instance , while a traveler may have caffeine for its arousal - promoting effects , the use of caffeine close to the time of sleep onset will result in difficulty falling or maintaining sleep.77 this often leads to exposure to light during the subjective night , which will further shift the clock out of phase with the new ambient light - dark cycle , resulting in further desynchrony . in order to avoid such a scenario ,\\nthis involves utilizing the prc to time one s exposure and avoidance of light and other resetting cues . in treating jet lag , re - entraining the sleep \\nwake cycle involves shifting the core body temperature minimum back to nighttime in the new environment through appropriately timed cues.32 the most effective time to begin treatment is prior to travel . shifting without major insomnia or sleepiness is best achieved gradually , and so timed exposure to bright light a couple of hours later than normal along with a progressively later bedtime will help phase delay the clock beginning a couple of days before taking a large westbound journey.32 the opposite is true for an eastbound journey , with an emphasis placed on exposure to light earlier in the morning when waking up to shift the clock forward.32 in general , it takes more time to adjust to a phase advance than delay ( or traveling eastward compared with westward ) .\\nwhen phase advances are sufficiently large ( > 8 hours ) , it might be easier and faster to delay the clock until synchronized with the new environment .\\nmammalian photoreception and phase shifting to light are optimized for environmental lighting conditions , which are generally much stronger than that of room lighting .\\nlight boxes have been effective in providing strong enough light directly to the eye to induce phase shifts , but this is not the case for all room lighting , especially when they are dimly lit .\\ntherefore , the best source of phase shifting light is sunlight , followed by light from a light box .\\nlight should contain wavelengths in the blue range , as this is where the photosensitive circadian system is responsive.78 during times when light should be avoided ( morning for a delay , evening for an advance ) , minimizing light exposure by drawing curtains , wearing sunglasses , using low - intensity room lighting , etc .\\nif a number of time zones are crossed during travel , light exposure schedules on the fight should be timed to maintain that the core body temperature minimum coincides with nighttime in the new environment.33 in presentation to the patient , one usually describes such strategies of light exposure in terms of going to bed earlier or later , rather than shifting rhythms .\\nhowever , it is important to understand that the act of going to sleep itself contributes to a phase shift mostly by altering activity levels and avoiding light rather than by resetting the clock .\\nthere is data to suggest that sleep does have small phase shifting effects independent of light,79 but these are minor in comparison to those achieved by light alone .\\nthis is not to imply that treating sleep disturbance is ineffective , but in the case of jet lag , sleep disturbance is a secondary target .\\none can recover sleep loss in just 12 nights , whereas the effects of jet lag can last much longer.32 the use of hypnotic agents , which are widely used for any sleep - related disturbance , including jet lag , may only mask the symptoms of jet lag .\\nthe phase shifting effects of most currently prescribed hypnotics are unknown , and even if hypnotics are used , light exposure times should be concurrently regulated .\\nmelatonin is the primary pharmacological agent used in the treatment of jet lag , and it is widely available in nonperscription form in the united states .\\nthere are also newly developed receptor specific subtype agonists that are available for prescription use , and these are thought to directly act on the scn with higher specificity .\\nlike in the case of light , there is a prc for melatonin that is necessary to utilize for its effective use in treating jet lag .\\nonly appropriately timed melatonin has phase shifting effects , even though larger doses of melatonin can have sleep - inducing effects independently of changes in the clock.80 in a simplified view , the prc for melatonin appears to be almost 180 out of phase with that of light : melatonin during the early evening phase advances the clock , whereas melatonin during the morning delays it .\\nthe dead zone for exogenous melatonin efficacy in phase shifts is during the period just prior to bedtime , when melatonin levels normally increase under low lighting conditions.33 this endogenous rise is thought to contribute to feelings of sleepiness via a mechanism that involves increased vasodilation and lowering core body temperature.51 under normally entrained conditions , endogenous melatonin synthesis is inhibited by light , and so its phase shifting effects during the early evening and morning hours are diminished .\\ndifferent doses of melatonin have slightly different prcs , and only higher doses ( 3 mg vs 0.5 mg ) have been reported to have direct hypnotic effects.32 there are also higher magnitude shifts reported for the higher dose of melatonin.32 if taking melatonin during the day when sleepiness is ideally avoided and cognitive function needs to be optimal , it is best to take a lower dose .\\nmelatonin by itself can be a potent chronobiotic , but the strongest phase shifting effects will be achieved when taken in concert with appropriately timed light exposure .\\nfor instance , in a phase delaying example , the traveler can take a low dose of melatonin and avoid light in the morning of the new time zone , and for phase advancing , melatonin should be taken in the early evening again with the avoidance of subsequent light .\\nfor instance , as discussed earlier , sleep is regulated by a circadian process along with a homeostatic process and can be modulated by different environmental conditions .\\nfeeding behavior , as another example , is also regulated by a circadian process , but feeding is also regulated by food availability , social cues , appetite , etc .\\nalthough all of these rhythms become desynchronized to differing extents during jet lag , most treatment strategies focus only on resetting of the central pacemaker in the scn .\\nthis is because inherent in most study designs , the phase of the clock is determined by core body temperature and melatonin onset , two events tightly regulated by the master clock itself .\\nthere is only a limited understanding of how other cues locally affect the resetting of tissues and organ systems .\\nthis is an important area of future research , as rhythms are now understood to be the result of multidirectional communicating networks .\\ntwo other areas in which phase shifting might be important for synchronization of events downstream of the master clock are exercise and timed feeding .\\nanimal studies suggest that appropriately timed exercise contributes to recovery from jet lag . in humans ,\\nthe data are much less consistent , but this could be due to the fact that the effects of exercise on phase shifting might exist primarily outside of the scn . furthermore , the appropriate intensity and timing of this exercise has yet to be determined in something like a consensus prc .\\nfrom what is known , however , the appropriate timing of moderate exercise appears similar to that of exogenous melatonin : exercise in the morning phase delays , and exercise in the evening phase advances.81 there is one major exception , though , involving a study showing that exercise at night in humans induces phase delays.82 it could be that in all cases , exercise promotes fatigue , napping , or some other altered form of time in bed . the phase shifting effects of exercise on the master clock are relatively low in magnitude , but in concert with other phase shifting paradigms , the effects can be additive .\\nit is still unknown whether or not exercise accelerates phase shifts in other brain areas or other clock networks in the body . for treatment purposes , drastically changing an exercise routine for treatment of jet lag is best avoided while the literature sorts itself out .\\nanother area where individuals can behaviorally accelerate realignment to the environment is through appropriately timed feeding .\\nthere has been a recent explosion of research in the field of food - entrainable oscillations , which are important for proper metabolism and also in synchronizing rest and activity rhythms.83 clock genes cycle robustly throughout the liver and the entire gi tract , and there is a normal circadian variation in gut motility that needs to be tightly regulated to maintain the sequential contraction of smooth muscle to push food and nutrients through the gut.84,85 peripheral clocks also show a hierarchical control in the circadian system , suggesting that there is some plasticity in control of synchronization at different levels of the body.86 data from animals also suggest that the scn and peripheral organs adjust to new environmental cycles at different rates , as peripheral organs appear to take longer to reset than the scn.87 this further contributes to the desynchrony within the body that accounts for the symptoms of jet lag .\\nthere is a noticeable lack of data on how feeding schedules can be used to re - entrain following a phase shift in humans .\\nironically , one of the major complaints following jet lag is bowel movement irregularity.88 one study on jet lag had suggested that a diet of high protein early in the day and high in carbohydrates later in the day accelerated a phase shift with military personnel , but this data has not been confirmed on a large scale , nor is the treatment necessarily feasible for everyone.89 regardless , a common sense approach to appropriately timed feeding is to gradually adjust meals to the new time schedule and avoid things like coffee and alcohol as they will interfere with quality of sleep and thus complicate the re - entrainment process .\\njet lag is a relatively common form of circadian disruption occurring when the core circadian system is out of synchrony with the environment due to the rapid shift of the light - dark cycle . during jet lag ,\\nthe various oscillatory components of the circadian system are likely out of phase with the central clock in the scn and consequently with each other .\\nthis disorganization of the circadian system leads to a cluster of symptoms including sleep disturbances and suboptimal cognitive performance . for short trips\\n, we would recommend accommodating to this biological challenge by appropriate scheduling , ie , avoid early light exposure after newly arriving after an eastward fight or avoid nighttime light exposure after westward travel .\\nin addition , proper sleep hygiene , including appropriate use of hypnotics , can be useful . for longer trips , synchronization to the new time zone can be aided by a variety of manipulations including timed light - exposure , melatonin , exercise , and timed meals .\\nimportantly , the goal of shifting one s clock should not be complicated by treating only sleep disturbances .\\nprcs should be used when available , but generally travelers can appropriately time light and melatonin if they expose themselves to light in the early morning and take melatonin in the late afternoon when traveling eastward , and by exposing themselves to light in the early evening and taking melatonin in the morning when traveling westward . as we have come to understand that an observable rhythm results from the interactions of many endogenously generated rhythms and environmental factors , treatment for jet lag - like sleep disorders should be multifaceted .\\nthese widely accepted clinical treatment strategies involving light , melatonin , and other nonphotic cues have been shown effective when appropriately timed , and future research with an improved understanding of circadian misalignment will undoubtedly be beneficial in continuing to link the appropriate timing of sleep and wake cycles to improved health and well being .\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n
